# Homebrew formula for the Audiobook Studio CLI (`abs`).
#
# Distribution: a prebuilt, self-contained tarball (abs + frozen G2P sidecar +
# libpdfium) produced by scripts/package-cli-tarball.sh and attached to a
# GitHub Release. The MLX Kokoro model is NOT bundled; it downloads from
# HuggingFace on first `abs generate`.
#
# Publish to a tap (StevenJPx2/homebrew-audiobook-studio):
#   brew install StevenJPx2/audiobook-studio/audiobook-studio
#
# Apple Silicon only (MLX requirement).

    # Self-contained payload (abs + libpdfium.dylib + sidecar/g2p_server) lives
    # together in libexec so abs's exe-relative lookups (cover.rs / g2p.rs)
    # resolve the sidecar and libpdfium next to the binary.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Audiobook Studio uses a local Ollama for chapter detection, OCR, and the
      optional polish pass. Install and start it, then pull the models:

        brew install --cask ollama   # or https://ollama.com
        ollama pull gemma4:e2b-mlx   # chapter detection + polish
        ollama pull glm-ocr:q8_0     # OCR for scanned PDFs (optional)

      Verify everything with:  abs doctor

      The MLX Kokoro voice model (~312 MB) downloads from HuggingFace on the
      first `abs generate`.

  test do
    # `doctor` runs without network/models and exits 0 unless ffmpeg is missing
    # (which is a hard dependency here), so it's a safe smoke test.
